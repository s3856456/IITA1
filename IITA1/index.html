					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Growing up I have always been around technology, whether it’d be at home or school, I was always interacting with a device. The initial interest was sparked when my father introduced his laptop back in 2006, it intrigued and perplexed my views on what was possible. Through a glass panel, whatever interests and questions I personally had, were answered through the device. If I required music or just some cartoons to watch, it was all on the screen. Therefore, I would be interested in learning to create software and programs, to contribute my fair share and to invoke interest in others, just as I was initially inspired. </p>
					<p>Shortly after high school, I was very confused as to what I wanted to pursue in my career which led me to applying for many different courses across many universities ranging from Monash University, Deakin University and RMIT University. I applied for a Bachelor of business: economics and finance which I then got an offer in the second round in February and accepted it as this is what I initially thought I wanted to do in university. However, after a few weeks of studying I began to lose interest in the course which then led me to deferring for two semesters. During my time away from university I took a deep think about what I really wanted to do in life. I asked myself what do I enjoy? What is something I am passionate about to the point where I’m willing to study and continue working in that field after I finish my course for the rest of my life. Still, I had no answer. I then began talking to my friends who are studying in university, asking them for suggestions. It was only till I was talking to my girlfriend’s sister’s boyfriend who studied in a bachelor’s degree of Computer Science at Monash and is now working a full-time job as a software developer till I realised what I wanted to do. He told me about how he would do coding and programming for his job which sparked my interest into doing I.T. I later applied for a I.T. course at RMIT and I have been enjoying every bit of it after realising this is what I really wanted to do in university, and I could not have been any happier. </p>
					<p>I chose to study at RMIT simply because of the reputation that RMIT has held over the years with its Information Technology course being one of the best in Melbourne. During my time studying, I intend on becoming well rounded individual capable of working in a fast-paced team environment and gain skills to allow myself to become a reliable teammate. I am to be proactive and go above and beyond with all work I am assigned to do. In terms of information-technology based skills, I aim to understand the complexity of coding and become a diverse programmer, able to tackle any problems faced. Upon completion I would like to not only grow my education but grow as a person. </p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
					<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/51669172?type=standard#searchRequestToken=04c082a4-e70a-4db7-a704-accd7d857075</p>
						<p><img src="software_engineer.png" alt="software_engineer" /></p>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This position facilitates all the stages during the development of software. Employees are required to utilise their technical skills to make products that stakeholders require. Examples of this are programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and C++. The reason that this career prospect interests me is because technology is always changing, and software engineers must adapt to this change to maintain their strength and position within the industry. Another reason as to why I would like to work in this field in the future is because it is not physically demanding and hence would allow me to work for longer.</p>
					<p>This job requires sophisticated technical abilities combined with professional skills. This is because although an employee may possess high problem-solving skills, they will not produce results if they are unable to effectively communicate ideas among team members and stakeholders. As a result of this, a minimum of five years of experience in the IT field is required before being taken into consideration by the employers (Synch Solutions Pty Ltd). Those who apply for this job must also have qualifications such as a university degree related to Computer Science. Different software engineering jobs may require different skills in certain software development tools and thus when looking for employment, jobseekers may need to specialise further in order to prosper and be successful in landing a job.</p>
					<p>As of 2021, I have been employed at Coles for more than a year starting in November 2019. In this job, I am required to effectively work in a team using communication to efficiently stock up inventory on shelves in a timely manner. This experience has therefore allowed me to work under pressure in a fast-paced environment. Although I currently do not possess high level technical skills, I am currently enrolled at RMIT studying a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and planning to major in Software Engineering. Hence, I look forward to being able to develop the essential skills needed to be a Software Engineer. In the future, I would like to apply for internships to develop industry experience and knowledge as this is essential for finding a job after the completion of my degree.</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>I have completed three online tests to present my personality profile to potential employers for them to gain a better understanding about myself. I begin my first test on Myers-Briggs which after receiving my results, I was shocked as to how accurately these traits represented who and how I am as a person, with the results concluding that I am introverted (54%), Intuitive (68%), Feeling (56%), Judging (81%), Turbulent (61%). Furthermore, I found out that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T) known to be one of the rarest personality types of all. </p>
					<p><img src="mbti_results.png" alt="MBTI Results" /></p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
					<p>My second test was about my learning style on educationplanner.org and the results show that I am a visual/tactile learner. I found this to be true as I have noticed that I am able to understand content that is handed out to me better when there are pictures or diagrams presented. Moreover, I have also been aware that I learn best by doing rather than listening or reading. </p>
					<p><img src="learning_style.png" alt="learning style" /></p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Big Five Personality Test</h2>
					<p>My third test was taken on openpsychometrics.org which reflects on our personality traits and the results were somewhat different from what I expected as it states that I am 81% extroverted whereas in contrast to my other result taken on Myers-Briggs test stated that I was 54% introverted. I believe that these results show a much more accurate depiction of my personality as I have always been an outgoing individual in my social life. Every other aspects of my traits from openpsychometrics.org appears to reflect about me precisely. </p>
					<p><img src="big_five_factor.png" alt="big_five_factor" /></p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>How these results may influence my behaviour in a team</h2>
					<p>Overall, these results are fairly accurate with some being different from one test to another. I believe that I would be suitable in working as a team as I am a very open-minded individual which in the IPIP test suggests that I am an agreeable person scoring at a percentage of 71% which is essential when it comes to coming up with ideas. Although my Intellect/imagination factor doesn’t show a high result at 34%, I am willing to listen to other people’s ideas and take them into consideration. Furthermore, despite my results on Myers-Briggs and IPIP being different, i am convinced that I can be both introverted and extroverted allowing me to work independently as well as work as a team since teamwork requires everyone to do both. </p>
				<article>

					<article>
						<h2>Things to consider when forming a team</h2>
						<p>When forming a team, I should take into consideration that I may have to include hard working team members that can participate and contribute their efforts equally in order to get the work that has been assigned completed and submitted before the deadline. Another important factor that I should take into account is that we are able to communicate clearly with one another as this plays a big role when it comes to working as a team. Furthermore, this allows us to share our ideas and elaborate on our thoughts, giving us the opportunity to create a masterpiece. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>A smart application that generates delicious and nutritious recipes for consumer desires. Within the app there will be various functions and usages such as evaluating the nutritional values of various foods and ingredients which creates recipes that strives to help users that will cater to achieve their nutritional and dietary goals. The end user will be provided a daily report which showcases the amount of nutrition consumed per day such as, calorie intake, carbs, protein, and fat etc.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The attaching image showcases on a chart the percentage of U.S. adults who would use an app to track their daily nutritional intake and diet which was conducted via a survey from 962 participants in March 2017. </p>
					<p><img src="dietarystats.png" alt="dietarystats" /></p>
					<p>Statistics indicate that 26% of those aged 18 to 29 years use an app to track their diet regularly meaning out of the 962 people, roughly 250 people are in that category. Moreover, results show that 23% of those aged 30 to 45 years use them occasionally which is equivalent to 221 people out of the overall participants. This indicates that there are still a portion of the population who utilises similar apps that provide dietary and nutritional planning. Moreover, the software that I have chosen to develop provides the essentials that people already use, including many features that no develop has integrated into their app. Using the evidence shown in the statistics above, by incorporating additional features, consumers are more inclined to have an interest in my app and consequently utilising it for their own benefit. </p>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>A personal dietitian for individuals seeking direction and guidance with meal preparations. Depending on the user’s goal (to lose fat, to gain muscle, maintain weight) the app will algorithmically generate a recipe encompassing a meal that satisfies the user’s needs and satisfies the nutritional needs of a person for each meal. With many apps currently available to download that provides a list of recipes for the users to prepare, this app differs from the other apps through additional features added that no other app has. This includes the ability for the software to generate recipes through garnering the pre-existing ingredients rather than collecting recipes online that may need some extra ingredients in-order to cook. This is a major step up as this app encompasses a dynamic algorithm which creates recipes based on ingredients already owned rather than spending extra on new ingredients thus benefiting users financially as they do not need to spend for every meal they prepare. This app also aims to ensure that we meet all user’s dietary requirements (vegans, vegetarian, food allergies and intolerances, religious reasons such as halal, etc) as health and safety including personal beliefs which should be considered as a top priority when it comes to designing an app related to foods. Hence, offering an additional menu that allows users to select and highlight what they can and cannot consume would benefit all end users. One key feature that this app provides is a daily report which highlights the amount of nutrition that is consumed each day which serves to promote a healthy diet as we can reflect on those results and make a positive change to reach our goal. An example to this may include tracking our calorie intake as this impacts our abilities to either lose or gain weight. By keeping a record of how many calories we consume each day we can distinguish whether we are reaching our goals such as a calorie surplus for putting on additional weight, or a calorie deficit for losing weight. In addition to this, if the daily goals are not yet reached by the end of the day, a notification will be sent to remind the user that they have either exceeded the recommended daily calorie intake, or they are well below the recommended daily intake. Another attribute is that there is an option that would allow the system to randomly generate a meal if we have not yet planned out our meals throughout the day. This is a useful tool for those who have trouble decided on what to cook throughout the day inclining them to likely skipping a meal which can result in tiredness as you are not providing your body with essential nutrients. This app is focuses mainly on being a user-friendly program allowing the user to navigate through the app with ease due to the quick and responsive feedback that this app delivers. For the first time launching this application, you will be asked to provide your height, weight, and age so that the system is able to calculate an accurate representation of what their specific body type is required to achieve a certain goal. However, it is not required if users do not feel comfortable sharing this information with the program. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>I plan to establish this app using appypie.com, which requires no knowledge in programming whatsoever. Since this is a group project, we will all be splitting off the tasks so that everyone gets assigned an equal amount of work which is to be completed through a shared document on Google Docs. We will also have our own discussion page on Discord so that we are able to communicate and help each other progress efficiently.  It is important that before this app begins its initial stages of development, we must conduct a thorough research to be able to make further progresses. We may need to research and analyse some statistics as to what users would prefer to be incorporated in the app. This can be achieved by looking at reviews of similar products on the market as there will be common errors reported that we could prevent from happening. Professional dieticians and chef’s advice may also be an essential human resource as they are able to provide more in depth information about each recipe. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Due to the website allowing us to develop an app without any knowledge on coding, sophisticated skills are not required to be put into use. The only requirement from everyone is to have basic knowledge on how to navigate through the website, hence creating an app will be done so with ease. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If this project is successful, it will provide many long-term implications such as developing good habits which serves to diminish poor dietary habits. Furthermore, this app serves an educational purpose which allows users to be more mindful with their food sustainability. We could also implement a user feedback mechanism which allows for further improvements and tweaks. </p>
